Description: Provides a streamlined workflow for clustering and visualizing 
  gene expression patterns, particularly from time-series RNA-Seq and 
  single-cell experiments. The package is designed to integrate seamlessly 
  within the Bioconductor ecosystem by operating directly on standard data 
  classes such as `SummarizedExperiment` and `SingleCellExperiment`. It 
  implements common clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, fuzzy c-means) 
  and generates a suite of publication-ready visualizations to explore 
  co-expressed gene modules. Functions are also included to facilitate 
  the visualization of clustering results derived from other popular tools.
