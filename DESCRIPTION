Description: For better clusteing and visualizing the time series gene expression data 
 of RNA-SEQ with fuzzy c-means algorithm from 'e1071' package 
 or Kmeans from 'ComplexHeatmap' package, the function 'blockwiseModules' from 'WGCNA' package 
 outputs also can be accepted and can be used to produce graphs for visualization, 
 here supply ClusterGVis package to cluster and visualize time-serie gene expression data 
 in a more concise and elegant way with one-step operation. 
 You can also do enrichment analysis for each clusters with using 
 'clusterProfiler' in 'enrichCluster' function. 
 'ClusterGVis' allows you to create publication-quality figures.
