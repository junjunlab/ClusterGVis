Description: For better clustering and visualizing the time series gene expression data 
 of RNA-SEQ with fuzzy c-means algorithm from 'e1071' package 
 or k-means clustering algorithm from 'ComplexHeatmap' package, the function 'blockwiseModules' from 'WGCNA' package 
 outputs also can be accepted and can be used to produce graphs for visualization, 
 here supply a package to cluster and visualize time-serie gene expression data 
 in a more concise and elegant way with one-step operation. 
 You can also do enrichment analysis for each clusters with using 
 'clusterProfiler' in 'enrichCluster' function. 
 'ClusterGVis' allows you to create publication-quality figures.
